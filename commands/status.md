## Phase Detection

To determine current phase, I'll check:
1. Design doc exists? → At least past Discovery
2. Plan doc exists? → At least past Planning
3. Tasks in progress? → In Execution
4. All tasks complete? → Ready for Completion

## Status Report

Based on the current state:

**Current Phase:** [Detected phase]
